=portfolioFigure($title, $imageURL)
  figure
    @data-id = 1
    @data-title = $title
    img
      @title=$title
      @alt=$title
      @src=$imageURL
    :"The title: $title"

should place :"The title: $title" as content child of <figure> and not <img>.


multipliers are still void tokens


single line content tokens should be placed on one tag-line if no other siblings
exist.


output should only indent and row-split if -x flag is set


test uncompressed content placements


normalize unquotes through mixins


test nested mixins
